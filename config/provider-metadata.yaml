Also RDB dumps are done according to backup schedule for backup purposes. When persistence is 'off', no RDB dumps and backups are done, so data can be lost at any moment if service is restarted for any reason, or if service is powered off. Also service can't be forked.
            valkey_pubsub_client_output_buffer_limit: (Number) Pub/sub client output buffer hard limit in MB. Set output buffer limit for pub / sub clients in MB.

            valkey_ssl: (Boolean) Require SSL to access Valkey.
            valkey_timeout: (Number) Valkey idle connection timeout in seconds.

                result in all servers in the group being placed on separate compute hosts. The value can be strict, yes, or no.
            id: (String) UUID of the server group.

            "no": refers to having no policy and thus no effect on server host affinity
            strict: policy doesn't allow servers in the same server group to be on the same host
            title: (String) Title of your server group
            track_members: (Boolean) Controls if members of the server group are being tracked in this resource. Set to false when using server_group property of upcloud_server to attach servers to the server group to avoid delayed state updates.
            "yes": refers to best-effort policy and tries to put servers on different hosts, but this is not guaranteed
