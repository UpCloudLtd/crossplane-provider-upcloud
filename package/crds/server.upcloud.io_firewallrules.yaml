        description: FirewallRules is the Schema for the FirewallRuless API. This
          resource represents a generated list of UpCloud firewall rules. Firewall
          rules are used in conjunction with UpCloud servers. Each server has its
          own firewall rules. The firewall is enabled on all network interfaces except
          ones attached to private virtual networks. The maximum number of firewall
          rules per server is 1000.

                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future

                  WriteConnectionSecretToReference specifies the namespace and name of a
                  Secret to which any connection details for this managed resource should
                  be written. Connection details frequently include the endpoint, username,
                  and password required to connect to the managed resource.
                  This field is planned to be replaced in a future release in favor of
                  PublishConnectionDetailsTo. Currently, both could be set independently
                  and connection details would be published to both without affecting
