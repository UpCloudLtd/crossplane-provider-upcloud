                      In addition to list order, the configured network interfaces are matched to the server's actual network interfaces by `index` and `ip_address` fields. This is to avoid public and utility network interfaces being re-assigned when the server is updated. This might result to inaccurate diffs in the plan, when interfaces are re-ordered or when interface is removed from the middle of the list.

                      We recommend explicitly setting the value for `index` in configuration, when re-ordering interfaces or when removing interface from middle of the list.

This might result to inaccurate diffs in the plan, when interfaces are re-ordered or when interface is removed from the middle of the list.

                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future

                      One or more blocks describing the network interfaces of the server.

                      In addition to list order, the configured network interfaces are matched to the server's actual network interfaces by `index` and `ip_address` fields. This is to avoid public and utility network interfaces being re-assigned when the server is updated. This might result to inaccurate diffs in the plan, when interfaces are re-ordered or when interface is removed from the middle of the list.

                      We recommend explicitly setting the value for `index` in configuration, when re-ordering interfaces or when removing interface from middle of the list.
